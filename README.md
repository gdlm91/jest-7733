# Jest 7733

This is a reproduction example of [jest-7733](https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/7733).

Using jest multi projects glob requires that all packages have a `jest.config.js` or jest will
also run jest from the root of the repo. This seems not obvious and causes weird issues which repos which required
different.

To reproduce:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/freshollie/jest-7733
cd jest 7733
yarn && yarn test
```

## Failure

```bash
$ yarn test
yarn run v1.16.0
$ jest
 FAIL  packages/a/some.test.js
  ● jest › should use the testSetup.js

    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

    Expected: "test"
    Received: undefined

      1 | describe("jest", () => {
      2 |     it("should use the testSetup.js", () => {
    > 3 |         expect(process.env.SOME_REQUIRED_ENV).toBe('test');
        |                                               ^
      4 |     })
      5 | })

 FAIL  packages/c/some.test.js
  ● jest › should use the testSetup.js

    expect(received).toBe(expected) // Object.is equality

    Expected: "test2"
    Received: undefined

      2 |     it("should use the testSetup.js", () => {

        |                                               ^
      4 |     })
      5 | })

## Fix

Specifying the jest configuration of each package will force Jest to NOT run test from Root, and not to try running
tests in projects that don't have a configuration file.

It will also use the root folder as the rootDir for dumping any coverage report

```bash
$ cat jest.fix.config.js
module.exports = {
   module.exports = {
    rootDir: ".",
    projects: ["<rootDir>/packages/*/jest.config.js"]
  };
}
```

```bash
➜ yarn test:fix
yarn run v1.17.3
$ jest --config jest.fix.config.js
 PASS  packages/c/some.test.js
 PASS  packages/a/some.test.js

```

## Work around

Specify the specific projects which need to be run:

```bash
$ cat jestworkaround.config.js
module.exports = {
    rootDir: ".",
    "projects": [
        "<rootDir>/packages/a",
        "<rootDir>/packages/c"
    ]
}
```

```bash
$ yarn test:workaround
yarn run v1.16.0
$ jest --config jestworkaround.config.js
 PASS  packages/c/some.test.js
 PASS  packages/a/some.test.js
